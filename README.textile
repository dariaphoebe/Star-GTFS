h1. Star GTFS

This is a Ruby on Rails application to play (or even do useful stuffs) with the GTFS dataset provided by "Keolis Rennes":http://data.keolis-rennes.com for the bus network of the city of Rennes, France. 

h2. Hey, I want to run my own instance!

So, you want to use this application or do things with, you have just checked out the latest version from the repository and ran @bundle@ to update your rails environment. What's next? 

You want to initialize the database with the official dataset. Fetch the zip file from the Keolis website and unzip it in @tmp/@. If you have time and want to do something else before everything else is ready, just run @rails runner script/import.rb@. If you don't want to wait 2 hours, edit the @database.yml@ file so that the @database@ file points at the @:inmemory:@ database instead of a file, run the aforementioned command line and then copy @db/import.db@ into the file that you won't forget to switch back.

The @import.db@ script takes the various csv files and put some parts into a database, plus some more that I thought more efficient at runtime (like, say, not using @trips@ but directly linking lines, stops and stop_times).

You can now start your server and point your browser at your usual URL (say, http://localhost:3000/).

At the time being, the application only uses a SQLite3 database and some people may gasp in horror, but apart from the import process, there's not a single data write/modification, so it should be powerful enough while still being probably the fastest solution for the import process using ActiveRecord (gotta love this inmemory setting).
